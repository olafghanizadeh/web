<p>There are many successful centralized hiring resources available on the web. &nbsp;Because these platforms were an&nbsp;efficient way to source, select, and manage a global workforce , millions of dollars was&nbsp;processed through these systems every day.</p>
<p>Gitcoin takes the value that flows through these system, and makes it more efficient and fair. &nbsp;Gitcoin is a distributed network of smart contracts, based upon Ethereum, that aims to solve problems with centralized hiring resources, namely by</p>
<ul>
<li>being more open,</li>
<li>being more fair,</li>
<li>being more efficient,</li>
<li>being easier to use.</li>

<p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee first invented the World Wide Web in the late 1980s&nbsp;to make information sharing on the Internet easier, he did something very important. He specified an open protocol, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP, that anyone could use to make information available and to access such information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Gitcoin is similarly built on an open protocol of smart contracts.</p>
<p>By specifying a&nbsp;protocol, Tim Berners-Lee opened the way for anyone to build software, so-called web servers and browsers that would be compatible with this protocol. &nbsp; By specifying an open source protocol for Funding Issues and software development scoping &amp; payment, the Gitcoin Core team hopes to similarly inspire a generation of inventions in 21st century software.</p>

In contrast to web2 where third parties own your data, in web3 you own your data and you are always in control.  On web3, your data is secured on the blockchain, which means that no one can ever freeze your assets or censor you.

<p>
"Gas" is the name for a special unit used in Ethereum. It measures how much "work" an action or set of actions takes to perform (for example, storing data in a smart contract).
</p>
<p>
The reason gas is important is that it helps to ensure an appropriate fee is being paid by transactions submitted to the network. By requiring that a transaction pay for each operation it performs (or causes a contract to perform), we ensure that network doesn't become bogged down with performing a lot of intensive work that isn't valuable to anyone.
</p>
<p>
Gas fees are paid to the maintainers of the Ethereum network, in return for securing all of the Ether and Ethereum-based transactions in the world.  Gas fees are not paid to Gitcoin Core directly or indirectly.
